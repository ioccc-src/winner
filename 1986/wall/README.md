## Judges' remarks:

The original version did not have a ';' character in the first line.
This caused a number of System V C pre-preprocessors to gripe about a
syntax error.

This program is a masterpiece of obfuscation and humor.  Larry Wall (the hacker
who gave us [rn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rn_&#x28;newsreader&#x29;) and
[patch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_&#x28;Unix&#x29;), etc.) asks you to compile and
consider the warning message generated by the C compiler.  Then execute the
program and type characters into its standard input.  You will see why the
compiler documents the program.
