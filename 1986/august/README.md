## Judges' remarks:

This program computes a specific mathematical value.  Simply compile
and give it an infinite amount of stack space and CPU time.  Otherwise
just be satisfied with the approximation displayed just before the core
dump.

This program will pass lint on your system assuming your lint is brave
enough to try and parse it correctly.
