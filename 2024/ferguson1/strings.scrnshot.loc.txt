This program simulates a trip over the Oregon Trail from Independence, Missouri
to Oregon City. Your extended family will attempt the 2170 mile Oregon Trail in
5-6 months. You had $6666 for the trip but after foolishly wasting thousands on
a sinful night yesterday and paying $200 for a wagon train, you only have an
ominous $1666. You may buy the following items, or not, if you trust the Devil
to be faithful to your pact:

 Food - the more you have, the less chance you'll starve to
        death, which would serve you right.
 Ammunition - $1 only buys 5 bullets due to recent hoarding.
        You will need lots of bullets for self defence
        and for hunting food, assuming you don't miss.
 Clothing - this is especially important for the cold weather
        you will encounter when crossing the mountains, if you
        get there.
 Oxen - the more you spend the better off you'll be, assuming
        they don't die. Or you don't sacrifice them.
 Miscellaneous supplies - this includes medicine and other
        things you'll need.

You can spend all your money before you start your trip or you can save some of
your cash to spend at forts along the way when you run low on supplies.
Alternatively, you might wish to spend it all as you'll probably just find
money along the way. You can also go hunting along the way to get more food,
assuming you're not such a lousy shot as to be unable to hit a helpless animal
from a cowardly distance.

At each turn, all items are shown in dollar amounts except bullets. When asked
to enter money amounts, don't use a $.

Good luck, because the Devil's not going to help out!!! Or...will he?

Shooting when low on bullets. That's really
intelligent. NO WONDER you're starving.

<17>

As you overindulge in a huge platter of spaghetti,
it suddenly begins to strangle you to death.

You gasp for air, reaching out to the Devil for
help! In vain. She's already here cackling like
the monster you are, just WAITING FOR YOU.

Your time has come my friend. But didn't you want
to know her better anyway?

Better go fulfil your promise! SHE WANTS YOU RIGHT
NOW! 💋

One of the daughters cut her arm and it had to
be amputated. THANK GOD she is not DOWN IN THE
MOUTH AND SHE WANTS TO EAT IT BECAUSE YOU ARE
SUDDENLY STARVING!!!

But OF COURSE you didn't get any. If you weren't
eyeing it so lustily you would have seen that she
seemed to ESPECIALLY ENJOY IT, GREEDILY DEVOURING
IT AS IF IT WAS HER LAST SUPPER! Wait, HAS THE
DEVIL POSSESSED HER TOO?! THAT EVIL WITCH!!! 🧙🧙🧙

Hang on. YOU'RE JUDGING HER AFTER ALL YOU'VE DONE?
CUT THAT OUT RIGHT NOW! NO. NO! NO! NO! STOP! I DID
NOT MEAN CUT ANOTHER LIMB OFF HER! YES I KNOW I got
some and you didn't. And yes it was DELICIOUS! But
she wanted me to remember it before it was all gone,
not you. Eat your own arm if you must. No. I meant
stop accusing her of witchcraft. YOU signed the
Devil's book, NOT HER and it WAS her body! This is
ALL YOUR FAULT, JUST LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE that's
happened since that fateful night!

<21>

Wagon train damaged! Lost time time resupplying from the Devil.

<22>

Suddenly your clocks stop...

I guess it must have happened AGAIN! And WHY THE DEVIL DO YOU
KEEP SWIMMING IN THE MOLASSES RIVER?! Honestly, you'll be lucky
if you don't SINK IN IT before it sinks into your
stick-in-the-molasses head.

<23>

            ⛰️⛰️⛰️⛰️

  You made it safely through South
  Pass--no snow. Clearly the Devil
  has your back. For now my dear
  fiend, for now...

  He might be plotting against you.
  Oh hell. I KNOW HE IS. HE TOLD ME
  HE IS. Your time is coming AND THE
  DEVIL AND I BOTH CANNOT WAIT!
  Neither can your daughters. They
  told me last night in the wagon.
  YES. I KNOW THEM.

Uh oh. A black cat just jumped out in front of you. Is
the Devil calling you? Better go have a look before it's
too late. Maybe it already is. Your daughters told me
you're an ailurophobe! Some pretty wild stories I hear.
I think it probably is too late. Isn't it Friday the
13th?

<29>

You take lots of cash 💰 from the riders 🏇,
accidentally stabbing one as he flees. But
since you're starving, why don't you MAKE
PENANCE BY NOT WASTING THE BODY YOU RUDELY
CUT OPEN?

WOW!!!! THAT'S A SPAGHETTI TREE!!! I saw
them over 100 years from now when I last
used my Time Machine!! The BBC will
cultivate them on April Fool's Day 1957!!
THEY'RE AMAZING!! The Time Machines are
okay and kind of interesting. Dangerous
though...

But the spaghetti looks pretty ominous,
doesn't it? IT LOOKS LIKE IT WANTS TO REACH
DOWN AND GRAB YOU! Better be careful. If they
strangle you YOU WILL GO TO HELL! On the plus
side... YOU'LL HAVE THE MOST AMAZING STORY to
tell your fellow sinners... Trust me. I've
been there on holiday! It's PRETTY WILD!!
Summers are AMAZINGLY HOT!! Although...GETTING
EATEN BY A DRAGON OR KILLED BY TYRANNOSAURUSES is
an EVEN BETTER STORY! That's MUCH MORE
EXCITING than a SPAGHETTI TREE KILLING YOU!!
Although...now I think on it...they're ALSO
in Hell so maybe it's better if the spaghetti
kills you. Want me to strangle you with it if
it doesn't do it? Of course...the trees are
there too...LOTS of parties too. And good old
TORTURE! IT'S AWESOME!

Blizzard in mountain pass--time wasted
asking Devil for help restocking.

Unfortunately, the unfaithful monster
only gives you ONE MEASLY BULLET. Like
that's going to help his most faithful

Perhaps you should have used a mountain
cable car 🚠, rather than relying on the
Devil! It's pretty funny you didn't know
he was unfaithful and yet expects complete
loyalty. Or else. HE'S COMING.

<36>

You have been on the trail too long and you die of
boredom.

You know you're lucky to have made it this long. Frankly
with your behaviour I'm surprised you didn't die from a
sinful disease much earlier. Or drowning in molasses. Or
freezing to death with your choice in clothing.

SERIOUSLY mate, you brought shorts, briefs, A DRESS AND
A BIKINI on the Oregon Trail? What the hell were you
thinking? Actually though...now I think on it...perhaps
Hell WILL serve you better? I hear the Summers are
AMAZING there! Winters, not so much.

At least your family gets free food now, assuming monsters
are edible. I'm not sure if they are. I suspect they would
be poisoned or die from your hot, burning flesh.

<37>

You'd better do some hunting or buy food soon, before you starve
to death! Or don't. Let's face it. You'd deserve it.

  Better than diarrhoea though,

  Frankly, it serves you right.
  If you hadn't wasted all that

  MIGHT have made it. But I guess
  there's no real difference;

be?

You FINALLY arrived at Oregon City after 2170
long miles!

TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH. Probably all your sinful
detours I've heard so much about but you'd think
that the Devil would have helped you out on that.
But I guess as long as you make it to your final
destination that's what matters, right?

Oh, right. Almost forgot! President Jesse James
asked me to wish you a prosperous life ahead of
you...in HELL!

<48>


      🔥🌨️🔥🌨️🔥🌨️🔥🌨️🔥🌨️🔥🌨️🔥
Phantom blizzard from Hell suddenly hits
and you freeze to death, leaving everyone
behind. You know the Devil 😈 is calling
you, right?

               🩳🩲👗👙

And with your choice in clothing, ARE YOU
REALLY SURPRISED YOU FROZE TO DEATH? I mean
SERIOUSLY mate, shorts, briefs, A DRESS AND
A BIKINI on the Oregon Trail? What the hell
were you thinking?  You're not in Hell,
you're on the Oregon Trail!

Although...now I think on it...perhaps Hell WILL
serve you better? I hear the Summers are GREAT
there! Lots of parties. Winters are -- actually,
there are no winters. ONLY WEATHER TO BURN YOU
FOR ETERNITY.

At least your family gets fresh meat on the bone,
assuming they can stomach eating a horrible
monster. If I were them I'D BURN YOUR BODY.

You shot a Bald Eagle 🦅. WHY, monster,
WHY?!

I mean look at its former strength, its
majesty! No wonder it became the symbol
of America!

GREAT JOB Devil worshipping pioneer, you
just killed America! I hope it's poisoned
or you at least choke on the bones.

Great shot! YOU GOT THE FATTEST ONE THERE! As if
that should be hard. IT COULD BARELY MOVE! But
with your WILD SHOOTING AND HORRIBLE AIM the
ONLY REASON you didn't miss by a hundred miles is
you signed the Devil's book, EVEN THOUGH IT WAS AS
WIDE AS A BLUE WHALE. There's no way you'd have got
such a nice shot EVEN IF THE POOR BEAST WAS
PRACTICALLY DEAD. I'm STILL surprised you didn't
shoot yourself in the eyes. But the Devil DOES
exact his dues and the animal might have been
poisoned. Eat at your own risk. OR STARVE.
Let's face it, YOU'RE DOOMED.

WHAT A TERRIBLE SHOT! How could anyone POSSIBLY miss a helpless animal that was
standing still, 100 FEET WIDE AND 150 YEARS OLD? IT WAS SO FAT IT WOULD MAKE
100 BLUE WHALES OBESE!

I hope you starve, you murderous beast, and it looks like you're going to,
after WASTING ALL THOSE BULLETS and MISSING FISH OUT OF WATER. You'd better
buy some food NOW.

Oh dear. That isn't the Barghest AGAIN is it? Better watch

always comes with a cost. And you and I BOTH KNOW that the women
were warning you - but you just HAD to have your way, didn't you?

Well the Oregon Trail is out to get you in every direction and
the odds are you won't make it out alive. You might be in good
company there, AND YOU AT LEAST GET TO SEE DINOSAURS ALIVE (LUCKY
YOU!!) BUT THERE'S NO AIR CONDITIONING and I heard it gets REALLY
HOT down there. Then again, I also heard there's no heater in
Heaven... Yup, either way YOU'RE DOOMED AND YOU KNOW IT! But don't

You got shot in the leg and they took one of your oxen,
whether or not you have any oxen left. Not that that matters much;
you're more than capable of stealing one, assuming you don't
sacrifice it to the gods. The Devil. I meant the Devil.

<81>

             WELL DONE, LAD!!!

Somehow, you scared the pirates off!
Unfortunately you also managed to steal
food and miscellaneous supplies from
the pirates as they fled, though I
honestly haven't a bloody clue how you
did that. I do hope you get food
poisoning so you can finally meet the
Devil like Blackbeard was SUPPOSED to
have. But aren't historians so awful,
lying about Blackbeard? YOU'RE NEXT,

There was a fire in your wagon. Too
bad only food and supplies were lost!
You know you deserve worse, right?

<83>

Lost your way in heavy fog but somehow you did
not lose much time, due to the STRANGE MAP in
the LAST BOOK you read.

You know which book I mean. Sure. IT IS a FASCINATING
READ! But you do know it's going to cost you though,
right?

<84>

🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉
🐉      A dragon eats you!              🐉
🐉                                      🐉
🐉 No, I know what you're probably      🐉
🐉 thinking. I would TOO! Who wants     🐉
🐉 to be eaten by a dragon? But THIS    🐉
🐉 TIME IT WAS NOT any of the grass     🐉
🐉 you understandably ate when you      🐉
🐉 were ravenous.                       🐉
🐉                                      🐉
🐉 No. I'm afraid not. The Earth is     🐉
🐉 flat, dragons are real and the Sun   🐉
🐉 is crazy. Oh and yes the Devil is    🐉
🐉 also real. But you ALREADY knew that 🐉
🐉 didn't you? Welcome to the harshness 🐉
🐉 of the Oregon Trail. Or was it the   🐉
🐉 Devil's bedchamber? Oh well, you're  🐉
🐉 dead now so no sense brooding over   🐉
🐉 what seems like Hell. Why not go to  🐉
🐉 the REAL Hell instead? OH HELL, WHY  🐉
🐉 NOT make it the Devil's bedchamber?  🐉
🐉 Be faithful. FOR ONCE. HELL, YOU     🐉
🐉 MIGHT EVEN ENJOY IT! No, not Hell.   🐉
🐉 Okay...actually...yeah, Hell too.    🐉
🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉🐉

You die of a snakebite because you stupidly didn't bring any
antivenin. Oh wait. I forgot. They haven't invented it yet
and nobody wants to suck the venom out of you. I'm actually
surprised they haven't abandoned you entirely. Oh well, now
they don't need to, although they might not be wise to have
the fresh off the bone meat.

Wagon train got swamped fording river; lost
food, clothes and an ox got stuck, whether or
not you spared no expense on oxen. Alas, you
couldn't save him.

WAIT. You didn't swim in the Molasses River
AGAIN, did you? HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO
REMIND YOU THAT THIS IS A VERY BAD IDEA? If
only you thought to bring a portable oven so
you could AT LEAST bake molasses cookies 🍪!
But you didn't. I hope you starve. Then you'll
be able to cook all the cookies in the world.
HELL. I MEANT IN HELL.

<87>

Wild dragons attack! And you actually thought you could shoot
them? Everyone knows dragons have armoured scales. I mean what
was the point? You should have brought yourself a pair of wings
so you could fly straight into the fire, so that you would've
gone out in STYLE and with an amazing legacy!

And no, I'm afraid you weren't hallucinating. The Earth IS flat,
dragons ARE real and the Sun IS crazy. Oh and the Devil is real
too. But you already knew that, didn't you, you filthy sinner?

<88>

Unfortunately, bullets won't help you with dragons; I'm surprised
you didn't know that. Anyone knows dragons have armoured scales.
Unfortunately for you they took a few oxen and upturned your wagon
train, causing you further delays.

Just be thankful you're still alive because this time you were walking
on dragon eggshells. No. If you did that you'd be dead. I meant walking
a thin line.

<89>

GREAT SHOOTING---they didn't get anything but you killed
one of your oxen and somehow you managed to upturn your wagon.

<90>

Really? You tried to shoot a dragon? Well that was pointless. They ate one
of your oxen and upturned your wagon train, causing further delays.

Okay so IT'S ONLY A HEART ATTACK ON A
PLATE but at least you'll survive another
day...if you don't have a heart attack
first, that is... Better have your Doctor
Beelzebub check you out. If he's still
alive. Oh no.

You didn't eat him when you were starving
last time, did you? If so I hope you DO
have a heart attack!

You got lost, losing valuable time asking
the Devil 😈 for directions to the

But honestly, HOW DID you get lost? It's
practically a TRAFFIC JAM OUT HERE AND
ONLY A COMPLETE MORON COULD LOSE THEIR WAY.

You ran out of medical supplies and unfortunately the Devil's in
Heaven on holiday / business and can't help you restock.

But honestly, who goes on a 2170 MILES journey WITHOUT bringing
medical supplies? You brought this on to yourself and you deserve it.
But at least I just heard that the Devil is on his way home to greet
you and thank god for that! Send me a postcard, will you? I want to
make sure it works out well for you down there.

Suddenly your clocks stop...

I guess it must have happened AGAIN! And WHY THE DEVIL DO YOU
KEEP SWIMMING IN THE MOLASSES RIVER?! Honestly, you'll be lucky

You made it safely through South

has your back. For now my dear
fiend, for now...

He might be plotting against you.
Oh hell. I KNOW HE IS. HE TOLD ME
HE IS. Your time is coming AND THE
DEVIL AND I BOTH CANNOT WAIT!
Neither can your daughters. They
told me last night in the wagon.
YES. I KNOW THEM.

asking Devil for help restocking.

Unfortunately, the unfaithful monster
only gives you ONE MEASLY BULLET. Like
that's going to help his most faithful
lieutenant? Oh but are you faithful?

Perhaps you should have used a mountain
cable car 🚠, rather than relying on the
Devil! It's pretty funny you didn't know
he was unfaithful and yet expects complete
loyalty. Or else. HE'S COMING.

please feel free to try the following instead:

Shooting when low on bullets. That's really
intelligent. NO WONDER you're starving.


<153>

 You take lots of cash 💰 from the riders 🏇,
 accidentally shooting one as he flees. But
 since you're starving, why don't you MAKE
 PENANCE BY NOT WASTING THE BODY?

             🍖🥩🍔🥩🍔🍖
        Mm...that was DELICIOUS!!!

(🪦👻RIDER'S SOBBING VOICE FROM THE GRAVE👻🪦)

 You know what you did is wrong, right? We
 were JUST ROBBED YESTERDAY, you rob us today
 AND NOW I'M DEAD 👻!

 WELL GOOD. I WAS DYING OF DYSENTERY and
 now YOU get to SPREAD THE DISEASE as well.

<154>

Uh oh. A black cat just jumped out in front of you. Is
the Devil calling you? Better go have a look before it's
too late. Maybe it already is. Your daughters told me
you're an ailurophobe! Some pretty wild stories I hear.
I think it probably is too late. Isn't it Friday the
13th?

<155>

Oh dear. That isn't the Barghest AGAIN is it? Better watch
your back! And front. And above you. Actually, YOU'RE DOOMED
and you know it. Your fate was sealed upon signing the Devil's
book. Honestly, what were you thinking? You HAD to have known it
always comes with a cost. And you and I BOTH KNOW that the women
were warning you - but you just HAD to have your way, didn't you?

Well the Oregon Trail is out to get you in every direction and
the odds are you won't make it out alive. You might be in good
company there, AND YOU AT LEAST GET TO SEE DINOSAURS ALIVE (LUCKY
YOU!!) BUT THERE'S NO AIR CONDITIONING and I heard it gets REALLY
HOT down there. Then again, I also heard there's no heater in
Heaven... Yup, either way YOU'RE DOOMED AND YOU KNOW IT! But don't
feel too bad. At least you won't FREEZE TO DEATH. You might here
though... Yup, FREEZE TO DEATH HERE and then BURN TO DEATH THERE!

You have died of exhaustion. I'm SURE
your victims ARE MOURNING FOR YOUR FAMILY.
Assuming they're not too busy EATING YOU
🍕🍔🍟🥪🌯🌮🌭 WITH THEM. I KNOW FOR A
FACT your daughters LOVE meat and I'm
sure they're already devouring you!
Hopefully they'll save some for everyone
else; it'd be a REAL SHAME if your body
went to waste...or would it be?

One of the daughters cut her arm and it had to
be amputated. THANK GOD she is not DOWN IN THE
MOUTH AND SHE WANTS TO EAT IT BECAUSE YOU ARE
SUDDENLY STARVING!!!

But OF COURSE you didn't get any. If you weren't
eyeing it so lustily you would have seen that she
seemed to ESPECIALLY ENJOY IT, GREEDILY DEVOURING
IT AS IF IT WAS HER LAST SUPPER! Wait, HAS THE
DEVIL POSSESSED HER TOO?! THAT EVIL WITCH!!! 🧙🧙🧙

Hang on. YOU'RE JUDGING HER AFTER ALL YOU'VE DONE?
CUT THAT OUT RIGHT NOW! NO. NO! NO! NO! STOP! I DID
NOT MEAN CUT ANOTHER LIMB OFF HER! YES I KNOW I got
some and you didn't. And yes it was DELICIOUS! But
she wanted me to remember it before it was all gone,
not you. Eat your own arm if you must. No. I meant
stop accusing her of witchcraft. YOU signed the
Devil's book, NOT HER and it WAS her body! This is
ALL YOUR FAULT, JUST LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE that's
happened since that fateful night!

WOW!!!! THAT'S A SPAGHETTI TREE!!! I saw
them over 100 years from now when I last
used my Time Machine!! The BBC will
cultivate them on April Fool's Day 19579!
THEY'RE AMAZING!! The Time Machines are
okay and kind of interesting. Dangerous
though...

But the spaghetti looks pretty ominous,
doesn't it? IT LOOKS LIKE IT WANTS TO REACH
DOWN AND GRAB YOU! Better be careful. If they
strangle you YOU WILL GO TO HELL! On the plus
side... YOU'LL HAVE THE MOST AMAZING STORY to
tell your fellow sinners... Trust me. I've
been there on holiday! It's PRETTY WILD!!
Summers are AMAZINGLY HOT!! Although...GETTING
EATEN BY A DRAGON OR KILLED BY TYRANNOSAURUSES is
an EVEN BETTER STORY! That's MUCH MORE
EXCITING than a SPAGHETTI TREE KILLING YOU!!
Although...now I think on it...they're ALSO
in Hell so maybe it's better if the spaghetti
kills you. Want me to strangle you with it if
it doesn't do it? Of course...the trees are
there too...LOTS of parties too. And good old
TORTURE! IT'S AWESOME!
