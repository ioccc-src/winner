## Judges' remarks:

This program was designed to maximize the bother function for
structured programmers.  This program takes `goto` statements to their
logical conclusion.  The layout and choice of names are classic.

We consider this to be a beautiful counter-example for Frank Rubin's
letter to ACM form titled: _["'GOTO Considered Harmful' Considered
Harmful"](https://web.archive.org/web/20090320002214/http://www.ecn.purdue.edu/ParaMount/papers/rubin87goto.pdf)_.
See the Communications of the ACM, March 1987, Page 195-196.
