# The original vik2 source
#
# On some systems such as Linux, this source either fails
# to finish compiling or takes a super-long time generating
# a huge number of compiler errors.  As such, we do not
# recommend compiling this code.  However for ailurophiles the
# curiosity factor, even though it may have the effect of:
#
#	kill -9 cat
#
# may be too strong to not try and compile the original
# vik2 source code.  Therefore we offer this special
# Makefile rule for those who do not wish to curtail (or cattail :-) )
# their curiosity.
