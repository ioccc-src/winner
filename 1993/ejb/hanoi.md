# The Towers of Hanoi puzzle

The Towers of Hanoi is a puzzle consisting of three posts
and several rings of various sizes.  The initial
configuration of the game is that all the rings are stacked
in decreasing order of size on one post.  The object of the
game is to move all the rings from one post to another
subject to two rules: only one ring can be moved at a time,
and at no time can one ring be placed on top of a smaller
ring.  The number of steps necessary to solve this puzzle is
exponential in the number rings.
