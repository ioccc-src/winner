# Twentieth International Obfuscated C Code Contest


## Standard IOCCC stuff

View the `index.html` web page for the given winning entry for information on how
on how to compile it and how to run the winning program.
Look at the winning source and try to figure how it does what it does!
You may then wish to look at the Author's remarks for even more details.

The IOCCC has a website and now has a number of international mirrors.
The primary site can be found at [www.ioccc.org](https://www.ioccc.org).

Use `make` to compile entries.  It is possible that on non-Unix / non-Linux
systems the Makefile needs to be changed.  See the Makefile for details.

This year we included most of the information included by the submitters
in the `README.md` files (that were used to build the `index.html` web pages).

Read over the Makefile for compile/build issues.  Your system may require
certain changes (add or remove a library, add or remove a `#define`).

Some ANSI C compilers are not quite as good as they should be.  If
yours is lacking, you may need to compile using gcc instead of your
local compiler.


## Remarks on some of the entries

There were some outstanding entries that did not win.  Unfortunately
some very good entries lost because they:

+ did not follow the "one program - one file" rule;

+ depended too much on 32 bit architectures;

+ were more of the "obfuscated math" kind rather than the "obfuscated C" kind.

We hope the authors of some of those entries will fix and re-submit
them for the next IOCCC.

We believe you will be impressed with this year's winning entries. The Best
of Show is a fine example of character stitching.  But don't ignore the other
entries!  There are games, puzzle solvers, utilities, eye candy, calculators and
graphical and audio tools.

This year all authors are different, and there is a authors from a new country -
China!  Many authors won for the first time. (Please note that judging is done
completely anonymously.  Be warned that we may disqualify entries that reveal
the identity of the submitter).


## Final Comments

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: See [contact.html](../contact.html) for up to date contact details
as well as details on how to provide fixes to any of the entries.
