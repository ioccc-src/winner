.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsnake\fP has two cheat modes (passable walls/self[cannibalism]), a drawing/practising mode, \fIcan play by itself\fP (\fBand win!\fP), is coloured (included \fIsnake-colours.sh\fP and \fIplay.sh\fP scripts compile in player\-selected colours) and there are many other play modes (many more can be devised with the imagination and the environmental variables; see \fBENVIRONMENT\fP and the file \fIgameplay.md\fP for many examples) and options.
You can pause and there's even a built\-in test unit for some features!
.PP
Besides the environmental variables (described below) that create for a lot of gameplay modes, here are some additional features:
.PP
.RS
\fB\(bu\fP A drawing mode (\fBWAIT < 0\fP makes \fBtimeout(3)\fP block).
.RE
.PP
.RS
\fB\(bu\fP Computer plays the game (\fBWAIT=0\fP)
\fB(EPILEPSY/STIMULATION OVERLOAD TRIGGER WARNING\fP included in the relevant section of the \fIgameplay.md\fP; this goes for low \fBEVADE\fP values too).
.RE
.PP
.RS
\fB\(bu\fP Grow\-Shrink (Positive and Negative Winning) mode (see \fIgameplay.md\fP for more details).
.RE
.PP
.RS
\fB\(bu\fP Different colours and characters for the bug, snake head, snake and walls:
.RS
\fB\(bu\fP Bug is \fB*\fP (white).
.RE
.RS
\fB\(bu\fP Head is an arrow facing the direction the snake is facing (\fB<\fP, \fB^\fP, \fB>\fP, \fBv\fP) (red).
.RE
.RS
\fB\(bu\fP Body is \fBo\fP (green).
.RE
.RS
\fB\(bu\fP Walls are \fB#\fP (cyan).
.RE

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The options are specified via the environmental variables.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The following environmental variables modify the behaviour of the game:
.TP
.B WAIT
Positive or negative integer that changes how long to wait for a key press prior to moving again.
< 0 blocks which allows for complete control over movement at your own pace.
Default 231; you can move faster by holding down or rapidly pressing an arrow key.
.TQ
.B WALLS
Whether the walls are passable or impassable.
Default 1, passable; 0 means impassable and you will die if you hit a wall.
.TQ
.B EVADE
How many movements the Snake makes before the bug (well insect) will move to another location in the field.
Default 300; 0 disables.
.TQ
.B SIZE
Initial size of the Snake.
Default 5.
Note that it grows by one per move so at the default 5 it will not initially be 5 characters long!
< 0 is an immediate win.
.TQ
.B MAXSIZE
The maximum size the Snake can become before the game is won.
< 0 is the maximum size based on terminal dimensions; any other size will be capped based on the terminal dimensions to prevent problems.
Note that when
.B SIZE + GROW >= MAXSIZE
you win
.I before
you grow to the full size!
.TQ
.B GROW
Size to grow every time you eat a bug.
Default 5; can be negative.
"Negativity" creates for fun gameplay modes with enough creativity.
See \fB\<https://www.ioccc.org/2020/ferguson1/gameplay.html\>\fP for some examples.
\fIplay.sh\fP allows you to reconfigure the colours and play different pre\-configured gameplay modes.
.TQ
.B SHED
Every
.B SHED
movements you will grow (> 0), shrink (< 0) or stay the same length (0) by the
.B SHEDS
(below) value.
Default 0.
Again with creativity you can create some fun gameplay modes.
\fB\- Exception\fP: if the bug is eaten the counter isn't incremented.
.TQ
.B SHEDS
Every
.B SHED
movements will impact what this value means: grow (> 0), shrink (< 0) or not at all (0).
Default 0.
Again with creativity you can create some fun gameplay modes here.
For instance you can grow upon eating a bug but shrink every
.B SHED
movements and then it's a battle of whether you win by
.B SIZE
< 0
or 
.B SIZE
>=
.B MAXSIZE\c

.I play.sh

.RE
.RE
.PP
The following two modify the terminal dimensions (this is not part of the game but the terminal/curses itself).
Elsewhere I document these more and their potential pitfalls.
.TP
.B LINES
The number of rows.
Default is the maximum size of the current terminal size (\fBecho $LINES\fP will show the current value).
Please note that this is not the number of playable rows but the entire game itself.
.TQ
.B COLUMNS
The number of columns.
Default is the maximum size of the current terminal size (\fBecho $COLUMNS\fP will show the current value).
Please note that this is not be the number of playable columns but the entire game itself.

.RS
Other versions I submitted. \fIprog.2.c\fP is the second version; \fIprog.3.c\fP and \fIprog.3-j.c\fP were the third where the \fI-j\fP version was a minor change to the J define.
\fIprog.alt.c\fP is the file that has support for colour customisation of the bug (this would have broken rule 2a/b so I could not submit it as my primary version).
It also clears the screen before playing to try and maintain terminal sanity should you pass the LINES environmental variable to the program.
.RE
.RE
.SH NOTES
The concept of shedding in this game is a misnomer.
This is how snakes grow in the wild so it is a misnomer here because snakes don't grow in the manner that the original Snake game was designed.
.SH BUGS
.PP
The screen keeps showing bugs (that aren't bugs :-) )!
.PP
There's no boss screen.
.PP
It was written by a human being.
.PP
Technically walls, snakeskin and the snake itself would \fBnot\fP be an obstacle in real life.
The shed snakeskin is not an obstacle but walls can be and so can the snake itself.
Also snakes grow by moulting (technical term for shedding) so when the snake leaves its snakeskin behind it really ought to grow but instead it shrinks; this means negative shedding ought to have the snake grow and positive shedding have the snake - what?
It's a misnomer: it took fewer bytes and the negative shedding is a positive consequence of unsigned arithmetic.
.PP
On a more serious note see \fB\<https://www.ioccc.org/2020/ferguson1/bugs.html\>\fP.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Test your terminal capabilities and get other various data (based on dimensions of terminal, growth size, size and max size as specified i.e. you can pass in the variables \fBLINES\fP, \fBCOLUMNS\fP, \fBMAXSIZE\fP, \fBGROW\fP and \fBSIZE\fp):
.nf
.RS
\fB
 make test\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
This is imperfect!
.PP
Allow the snake to go through itself but not through walls, make the snake move at 400ms and start out at size 7:
.nf
.RS
\fB
 CANNIBAL=1 WALLS=0 WAIT=400 SIZE=7 ./snake\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Let the snake go through itself and the walls, make the bug stay put until it's eaten, have the snake grow by 7 every 150 snake movements, start out at size 4 and grow by 7 every time a bug is eaten:
.PP
.RS
.nf
 \fBCANNIBAL=1 WALLS=1 EVADE=0 SHED=150 SHEDS=7 SIZE=4 GROW=7 ./snake\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
Allow the game to play by itself, winning, after starting the game (move in a direction) (\fBDON'T TRY IF YOU HAVE EPILEPSY!\fP):
.nf
.RS
\fB
 CANNIBAL=1 WAIT=0 MAXSIZE=30 SIZE=0 EVADE=1\fP ./snake
.fi
.RE
.PP
That allows the snake to go through itself, makes the max size fairly small (to make it easier to win and quicker), sets the size to 0 (start with only the head) and make the bug move every time the snake moves (and does not catch it). Once you move the snake a direction it moves so quickly that because the bug is evading the snake inevitably runs into the bug thus growing in size etc.
.PP
Run script that prompts for the colours to be used, compiles and then runs the game (with environmental variables passed in):
.nf
.RS
 \fBCANNIBAL=1 SIZE=15 MAXSIZE=45 WALLS=0 ./snake-colours\fI
.fi
.RE
.PP
That will compile the game to be the colours you select and then enable cannibalism, set the starting size to 15, max size to 45 and walls are made impassable.
