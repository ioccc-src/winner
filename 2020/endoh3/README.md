## Judges' remarks:

You may be tempted to use a mirror. Resist the temptation! Try figuring out how
the clock hands are drawn.  Can you change the program to make it draw a
familiar (non-mirrored) clock face? Can you add the second hand?

When using the [run_clock.sh](%%REPO_URL%%/2020/endoh3/run_clock.sh) shell script, your perception of
time might depend on what time it is.


## Author's remarks:

Prepare a mirror!

``` <!---sh-->
    make clock
```

Note: You need to recompile it each run.
