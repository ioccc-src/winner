## To build:

``` <!---sh-->
    make
```

There is an alternate version of this entry which should work for Windows by
setting binary mode on `stdout`. See [alternate code](#alternate-code) below.


## To use:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./persano p q [num frames]
```


## Try:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./try.sh
```

Open the [GIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF) files with a viewer capable of
displaying animated GIFs and watch closely at the bottom of the picture (you may
need to use [gifsicle](https://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/) - a great tool to
manipulate animated GIFs - to slow down the animation and to compress the GIFs
generated by the entry).


## Alternate code:

This (untested as we have no Windows system) version uses the Windows API
functions `_setmode()` and `_fileno(3)` to set binary mode on `stdout` which should
let it work with Windows.


### Alternate build:

```
    make alt
```


### Alternate use:

Use `persano.alt` as you would `persano` above.


### Alternate try:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./persano.alt 3 16 > knot3-16.gif
```

Follow the same instructions, using different tools if necessary, as the above
try section.


## Judges' remarks:

If your system is one of those that distinguish between text and binary
streams, you must know what to do to switch the standard output into
binary mode (e.g., adding a line to the source code or specifying a
linker option).

What needs to be done to fix the problem?

Solving the author's exercises below may or may not help.

At the time of judging, the approximation of
[π](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi) used in the program could not be found on

## Author's remarks:

**knot** writes animated GIF images of rendered [torus
knots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus_knot) to standard output.

### SYNOPSIS

``` <!---sh-->
    ./persano p q [num frames]
```


### DESCRIPTION

A `(p,q)`-[torus knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus_knot) is a closed,
non-intersecting curve on the surface of a
[torus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus) in R3 that winds `p` times around
one cycle of the torus and `q` times around the other. `p` and `q` should be
[coprime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprime_integers); otherwise, the
resulting curve will _not_ be a knot (that is, imagining the resulting curve as
a loop of rubber, there will be a way to bend, twist and stretch it, without
cutting it [^1], until it ends up looking just like a circle embedded in R3 [^2]).

Sample usage:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./persano 3 2 1 > foo.gif
```

writes a non-animated GIF (a single frame) stream of a rendered trefoil
knot to the file `foo.gif`.

``` <!---sh-->
    ./persano 5 2
```

writes a GIF stream with a rendering of [Solomon's Seal
knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon%27s_knot) to standard
output; since the number of frames is not specified, an animation with
40 frames will be written.

Please view the code with 8-character tabs!


### OUTPUT FORMAT

The program writes fully valid GIF 89 streams.

It is suggested that the output be viewed with a program capable of
displaying animated GIFs, such as almost any graphical HTTP browser.

Due to code size constraints, full [LZW
compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78#LZW) was not
implemented [^3]. In fact, the output images are even somewhat expanded, thanks
to GIF overhead.

The GIF format supports only a limited number of bits per pixel, so the
program uses ordered dithering to emulate full RGB output.


### PORTABILITY

The program was tested on Linux, with gcc 3.1; Cygwin, with gcc 3.3; and
Solaris/SPARC, with Sun's C compiler.

The only major portability issue should be reliance on ASCII.

It should also be mentioned that the program won't work on systems that
distinguish between text and binary streams; however, since hardly
anyone uses such systems in this day and age, this is a minor issue. [^4]


### EXERCISES FOR THE READER

1. (1 point) The surface is composed of many small polygons. Try to make it
smoother by increasing the number of polygons.

2. (2 points) Figure out how to change the radius of the tube cross section.

3. (5 points) Locate the famous transcendental constant
[π](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi) in the code.


[^1]: You can call such a transformation an "ambient isotopy" if you want to
impress people at parties.

[^2]: Also known as the "unknot", which sounds slightly less impressive than
"ambient isotopy".

[^3]: Unfortunately (for the author), the convenient excuse that LZW compression
was not implemented in order to avoid the Unisys patent can no longer be used.
