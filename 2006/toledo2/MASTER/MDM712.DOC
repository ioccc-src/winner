NOTE:  MDM712 SUPPORTS AUTO-DIALING AND AUTOMATIC CONTINUOUS REDIALING
       FOR THE FOLLOWING MODEMS:

                    PMMI 103 S-100 PLUG-IN MODEM
                    HAYES SMARTMODEM 300 OR 1200 MODEMS
                    U. S. ROBOTICS 300/1200 MODEM

       (IT CAN STILL BE EASILY USED WITH OTHER EXTERNAL MODEMS
       WITH MANUAL DIALING SUCH AS THE BELL 212A, RACAL-VADIC, ETC.)
       IT SUPPORTS UP TO TWO LONG-DISTANCE DIALING SYSTEMS (SUCH AS
       'MCI', 'SPRINT', 'TYMNET', ETC. FOR TOUCH-TONE DIALING SYSTEMS.

INTRODUCTION:
------------

     MDM712 enables a computer to communicate with another computer.
This is normally done by using standard telephone lines but with special
audio tones sending serial data.  Two common speeds are used, depending
on the facilities available -- 300 Baud or 1200 Baud.  A "modem" is used
which provides these audio tones.  This is an acronym for "modulator and
demodulator".  The one section (modulator) provides the audio tones for
sending over the telephone line and the other section (demodulator) then
converts those audio tones back to digital pulses the computer uses to
receive the incoming data.

     The modem itself is a hardware utility, usually costing around $100
to $250 for a typical 300 Baud device and from $400 to $800 for a system
offering 1200 Baud as well as 300 Baud.  Some of these (such as the PMMI
S-100 modem board) plug directly into the computer itself, while others
are totally independent of the computer and use an interconnect cable
(usually a RS-232 type) to control the external modem.  A Bell 212A is
an excellent example of this type modem.  Other examples would include
the Racal-Vadic, Hayes Smartmodem, U. S. Robotics, Prentis, etc.

     The program discussed in this guide allows each computer involved
to directly control its own modem, converting DC pulses into audio tones
which are sent to (or received from) the telephone line.  (The standard
1200 baud transmissions use "DFSK" (phase shift keying) instead of "AFSK"
(audio frequency shift keying).

     For short distances, no modems are required as the computer can
provide the necessary digital voltages.  This discussion is centered
around systems intended for use over distances ranging from several
miles to literally around the world.



FEATURES:
--------

     A program to communicate with another computer can range from very
simple to very complex.  MDM71 is one of the more complex such programs
available today.  It started in 1977 as a relatively simple program.  It
was called MODEM2 at that time.  It was intended to be used primarily as
a means of exchanging programs with other people in other cities.  Since
that time a number of other (very useful) features have been added, in
addition to improved methods of program transfer.  A list of some of the
features offered by this particular program include:

  1)  Ability to talk with another computer via keyboard at each end.
          (Called the "terminal mode".)
  2)  Ability to operate a remote mainframe computer such as TYM-SHAR,
          or special data bank systems now commonplace.  This includes
          "bulletin board" systems for receiving, sending or just read-
          ing messges or other types of information.
  3)  Ability to upload (send) or download (receive) programs from other
          computers whether TYM-SHAR, data banks, remote hobby systems
          or just another individual in another location.
  4)  Ability to copy incoming information on a printer.  If the print-
          er is too slow to copy the data directly, the extra characters
          back into a large storage buffer until they can be printed.
  5)  Ability to copy incoming data into memory for automatic transfer
          to a disk file.
  6)  Accomodates any computer clock speed up to 25.5 MHz. in 0.1 Mhz.
          increments for uniform results.  (The clock speed is actually
	  of modest interest, it is only used for setting timing loops.)
  7)  Advanced type of error detection (CRC or Cyclic Redundancy Check)
	  using automatically generated high-speed lookup tables.
  8)  Automatic disconnect from the telephone line when using "BYE", "X"
	  or CTL-D.  Two other disconnect commands with the PMMI modem.
  9)  This particular program has additional features of special inter-
	  est to those using the PMMI 103 S-100 plug-in modem, the U. S.
	  Robotics 300/1200, or the Hayes Smartmodem 300 or 1200.  Those
          features basically include automatic dialing and redialing (if
	  requested) until the other computer finally answers.
        
               a) Automatic selection of a particular phone number from
                  a library of names and numbers.
               b) Automatic dialing for alternate long-distance systems
                  (where auto-dialing touch-tone modems are used).
               c) Entry of a hand-typed number.  Although it might be as
                  simple to manually dial the number as hand-type it, it
		  can then be automatically redialed indefinitely.


USING THE PROGRAM THE FIRST TIME:
--------------------------------
 
     For now, we shall assume the program is ready to use on your equip-
ment.  (Normally the user must make some modest changes to the program
before it can be used.  This includes changing the port numbers and some
other personal options.  These will be covered later in the section that
describes how to adapt it to your equipment.)

     When the program is brought up is shows this display (if using the
PMMI modem):
 
 
          MDM712 - (type M for Menu)
          Version for PMMI S-100 modem starting at port: C0H

          B>>COMMAND: x


       The cursor stops at point "x:" waiting for some sort of command.
Typing a "M" followed immediately by a RETURN, shows the first page of
a 4-page help guide.  If you do not have a PMMI modem, you would have
seen this (or a customized heading for your particular equipment):

          MDM712 - (type M for Menu)
          Version for Non-Pmmi modem

          B>> COMMAND:


     In this case only a 3-page help guide is used, since the 4th page
is used to assist those with the PMMI modem.  It tells them a little
about changing from originate to answer mode, how to change Baud rates,
how to disconnect, etc.

     Several commands are similar to those already used for CP/M, such
as 'ERA', 'DIR' and the ability to change disk drives and user areas.
This adds tremendous flexibility while remaining in the modem command
mode.  To change disk drives, just say:

          B>>COMMAND: A: <RET>

     and you are in the same user area on the A: drive.  You can also
say:
          A>>COMMAND: A: 12 <RET>

     to change user areas.  When finished (using this example), say:

          A12>>COMMAND: CPM  <RET>

     and you will go back to CP/M with the original driver and user area.

OPTIONS:
-------

     There are 6 primary options and 13 secondary options that may be
typed on the command line.  In additon there are over 35 commands ranging
from single character to three characters that can be used (such as DIR,
ERA, LOG, etc.)  Those are listed on the menu.  (The exact number varies
depending on whether you have the PMMI modem, etc.)


     Primary Options:    E, L, M, R, S, T
          E = Echo mode (special type of full duplex)
          L = Local modem (no remote echo, half duplex)
          M = Menu display showing features that are available
          R = Receive a file from remote facility
          S = Send a file to a remote facility
	  T = Terminal mode (full duplex, echo provived remotely)

     Secondary Options:  A, B, D, L, O, Q, R, S, T, V, X, 0, 1
          A = Answer mode (used only by PMMI modems)
          B = Batch mode -- allows automatic multiple file transfer
		(This is normally only used from modem-to-modem as
		no RCP/M system supports batch mode file transfers.)
          D = Disconnect when done, stay in MDM712
          L = Local mode when finished with a file transfer
          O = Originate mode (used only by PMMI modems)
          Q = Quiet mode, special purpose feature rarely used except if
                 operating through a "BYE" program.
          R = Receive data shown on CRT during file transfer
          S = Send data shown on CRT during file transfer
          T = Terminal mode when finished with a file transfer
          V = Visual inspection of an ASCII file being transferred.  Not
                 often used as most ASCII files are now "squeezed" for
                 minimum transfer time and disk space.
          X = Exit to CP/M  when finished, disconnect from phone line
          0 = Odd parity (PMMI modem)
          1 = Even parity (PMMI modem)
	

     Although you can get the following information from the help guide
in MDM712, showing it here will allow us to discuss the various features
in somewhat better detail.

DISCUSSION OF HELP GUIDE PAGE 1:
-------------------------------

     There are basically three types of commands that may be used with
this program:
               1)  Single-letter commands shown on page one.
               2)  Three-letter commands shown on page 2, and
               3)  Control-<char.> commands shown on page 3.

     Going down the list:

  ? - shows current parameters.  As these are closely tied in with some
          of the other options, we shall show a typical example later
          in this discussion.
  M - shows the menu a page at a time.  You may abort after any page is
	  shown with a control-C.
  E - terminal mode with echo.  When talking with another terminal also
          also using MDM712 (or a comparable program), one of you must
          send an "echo-back" so you can both see what the other person
          is typing.  This is needed for full-duplex operation.  Usually
          the person originating the call will type "E" instead of "T".
          However either may do this.  If "both" use the echo mode, the
          program usually starts typing a string of feedback characters
          since both computers are re-sending the same character over
          and over.  You can stop this by just returning to command mode
          (type control-E) and then retyping "T" rather than "E".
  L - terminal mode with local echo.  Shows what you are typing but does
          not send an echo of the other person's typing back to him.  
          Can be used at both ends, in place of one person using "E".
          Both "E" and "L" are useful at times for some types of modems
          that do not use full-duplex, or for some main frame units that
          run half-duplex.  The combination of "T", "E" and "L" gives an
          excellent choice to use on various systems.  Normally the "T"
          mode is sufficient except when talking with another person and
          then the "E" mode at one end or "L" mode at both ends will
          provide normal results.
  T - if typed as the first (primary) option, puts the program directly
          into "terminal mode", allowing it to send from the keyboard to
          the other computer, and to copy anything coming from the other
          computer with the exception of file transfers (use "R" to re-
          ceive those).
  R - used only for receiving files from the other computer.  These are
          usually sent in binary form with either checksum verification
          or more commonly, CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Checking).  If ready
          to receive another file, you have several choices, depending
          on the program used by the other computer.   After notifying
          him you are ready (or will be very shortly), you can tr 4 €windows which scroll together.# This command is used to hold column#€titles or row headings in place$ while cells are scrolled. Parameters$€are: € % 1.  Number of rows to become a window%„across the top of the screen.! 2.  Number of columns to become a!!„window at the left of the screen.! € ' The remaining display space becomes the'!€active window which is linked for!#nal window for&€synchronized scrolling€in the vertical direction. € €WINDOW SPLIT TITLES €   Splits active window into 2 o automatically
          places you in a "ready to go again" situation when the trans-
          fer is finished.
 
          Another "R" option would be:

               B>>COMMAND: RB <RET>
 
          This is called the "Batch mode" and is an extremely useful way
          to receive programs automatically, from another computer using
          a similar program.  He will use the batch mode for sending the
          programs and that automatically provides the file names at the
          receiving end.  In this manner, large numbers of programs can
          be transferred completely automatically, including full disks.
          (Assuming you care to pay the toll calls for the time it will
          take!)

          NOTE:  The ideal way to receive batch mode would be:

               B>>COMMAND: RBT <RET>

                 since you may not know in advance how many programs he
                 will be sending.  When the transfer is complete, you
                 are automatically in the "T" mode and he can start
                 typing to you, immediately, with any comments relative
                 to the progress of the transfer, etc.  (He would use
                 the "E" mode.)

  S - Send programs.  Similar to "R" but sends instead of receives.  If
          the other system is ready to receive, you can type:
 
               B>>COMMAND: S HELLO.DOC <RET>

          It will tell you how many records are involved and how many
          minutes and seconds it will take to send the program.  If the
          other system is ready to receive, it starts the transfer,
          showing how many records have been sent.  If any errors occur
          during transmission, it shows what they are and counts them.
          It will resend any records not correctly received at the other
          computer.  If too many consecutive errors occur (normally set
          at 10), the transfer is terminated.  The batch mode may also
          be used for sending:

               B>>COMMAND: SB HELLO.*

          will send all files starting with HELLO, or can send just one
          file, or can send several non-related files in this manner:

               B>>COMMAND: SB HELLO.DOC XDIR.COM TERM.*

          etc.  Be sure to put a space between the various files.  You
	  can include the 'X' option:

               B>>COMMAND: SBX HELLO.* MDM712.LBR MDM712.AQM

          When the file transfer is completed it disconnects from the
          phone line and reverts to CP/M.  This allows you to be absent
          when the file is finished, offering an advantage when sending
	  lengthy files.

DISCUSSION OF HELP GUIDE, PAGE 2:
--------------------------------

  CPM - This returns to normal CP/M use, abandoning MDM712.
          CAUTION: It does not disconnect the modem from the phone line.
  DIR - Enables the user to see the library of any disk without needing
          to return to CP/M first.  Can be adjusted when installing the
          program to show 3, 4, or 5 groups depending on the width of
          your CRT display.  Normally set to 5 for 80-column displays.
          Shows the amount of disk spacing remaining on the logged-in
          default drive.  (You must log in any drive you wish to write
          on, or to see the correct free disk space remaining.)  See the
          LOG feature below.
  ERA - Enables the user to erase any files from any disk without the
          need to return to CP/M first.  Wild cards (* and ?) accepted.
  LOG - When a new disk is inserted, you can see the directory and read
          files from it but cannot write to it without getting a "BDOS
          ERR".  This command allows you to log in a new disk so you can
          immediately write on it without first returning to CP/M for a
          warm boot.  You can select drive and user number.  (This also
          enables DIR to show the correct free disk space remaining.)
	  You can say:
                         LOG <RET> for same drive, user area, new disk 
                         LOG A
                         LOG A:
                         LOG A14     (user areas are 0-15)
                         LOG A11:

  SPD - Sets the delay between characters and/or delay between lines in
          the "T" mode when using control-T to upload a pre-typed file.
          Since most bulletin boards and TYM-SHAR systems normally use
          line editors that require a delay after they have received a 
          line, you can add delay between characters (in increments of
          10 ms.) and/or enter delay between lines (in increments of 100
          ms.).  This is preset for most systems at 50 and 500 ms.  They
          can be changed at any time.  Current values can be checked by
          using the  " ? " command.
  TIM - This option lets you set the file transfer time from 110 Baud to
          9600 Baud.  You can preset it (when installing the program) to
          the value normally used, but at times it is nice to be able to
          conveniently change the time shown to a different rate.  Some
          initialization routines (discussed in the install section) can
          make this change automatically.  This command does not show if
          using the PMMI* board as the speed is automatically changed to
          agree with the current Baud rate selection.  It also does not
          show if the custom overlay uses the SET command to choose var-
          ious Baud rates as the transfer time is changed automatically.
  TCC - Most modem programs originally used simple checksum verification
          of received sectors.  Most now use Cyclic Redundancy Checking
          which finds certain transmission errors the simple checksum
          system might overlook.  This toggle allows the user to select
          checksum for those systems known to not offer CRC.  When set
          normally to CRC, the program automatically switches to check-
          sum after trying several times to use CRC.
  TBR - Some systems use the "rubout" key for backspace.  This toggle
          allows you to readily adapt to those systems.  Rarely used.
  TLC - Nearly all computers use "control-characters" to do various
          tasks such as move the cursor around, clear the screen, reboot
          the system, etc.  You might want to send a control-E character
          to the local computer and not have it go to the remote system
          at the same time.  Say a moment later you would like to send a
          control-E only to the remote computer.  You would do this:

               control-E              (goes to local computer only)
               control-^ control-E    (goes to the remote computer only)

          You can reverse the TLC toggle causing this response:

               control-E              (goes to remote computer only)
               control-^ control-E    (goes to the local computer only)

          All other control-chars. would operate in a similar manner.
          This gives extra flexibility in using this program for special
          systems like TYM-SHAR, etc.

          NOTE:  If using control-^ is awkward, you can pick a different
                 character when installing the program initially.

  TLF - If sending a file while in terminal mode (via CTL-T option) most
          mainframe computers will not want you to send a line feed.  As
          all editors include the LF after CR, you have the option with
          this toggle of sending or not sending a line feed.  If typing
          manually in the "T" mode, you can get a line feed with CTL-J.
          It is automatically included after CR with "L" or "E" modes.
  TXO - Used when uploading pre-typed text files to other systems such
          as TYM-SHAR or bulletin boards, etc.  Most of those have line
          editors that take a moment to move the line you just finished
          from their edit buffer into memory.  The XOFF character halts
          your system from sending until it is ready for a new line.
          Used only in the terminal mode.
  NUM - Not shown if using PMMI*.  This shows the non-PMMI* people the
          phone library numbers which can be used for manual dialing.
  SET - Not shown if using PMMI, or if SETUPR is set to "NO" (indicating
	  no user routine in the overlay for choosing different speeds.)
  BYE - Disconnects the modem from the phone line, closes any file that
          may be open and returns to CP/M.
  CAL - PMMI* command, shows the phone library for auto-dialing.  If not
          using a PMMI*, this will not be shown, instead NUM is shown.
          It displays the telephone library.  (Non-PMMI users will find
          the NUM display beneficial as it can display useful phone num-
          bers for manual dialing.)

        NOTE:  Use the phone number overlay to easily change the numbers
               that are stored.  This overlay also accesses up to two
               alternate long distance dialing systems for the touch-
               tone auto-dialing modems.

  DSC - Disconnects the modem from the phone line whenever selected.
  DEL - If copying incoming information into memory, and you decide you
          do not want to bother saving it to disk after all, this closes
          (and then deletes) the disk file you had opened.
  WRT - saves what you have been copying to the disk file already opened
          for that purpose.  When returning from the "T" mode to command
          mode, a warning is shown that you may lose what has been saved
          unless you use WRT (write to disk).

DISCUSSION OF HELP GUIDE, PAGE 3:
--------------------------------
                   
  CTL-@  - Sends a break character to the other computer.  Used in some
             TYM-SHAR systems, etc.  (Used only in PMMI mode)
  CTL-B  - PMMI command, changes the Baud rate from 110-710, in addition
             changes the file transfer time accordingly.
  CTL-E  - Returns to command modem from "T", "L", "E" modes.
  CTL-L  - Will send the log-on message if TRANLOGON is set YES and a
             message has been included in the LOGON area.  Can use this
             feature to sign on various bulletin board systems, although
             that would require an identical password on each.
  CTL-N  - Disconnect the modem from the phone line.  (CTL-D had been
             used for this command, but it was too easy to accidently
             type CTL-D when expecting to hit CTL-S or CTL-E or CTL-X.
             You can easily change this to whatever you like in the
             overlay you use for your equipment.)
  CTL-P  - Toggles the printer on-off.  Very useful feature.  Similar to
             normal control-P but in this case if the modem is running
             faster than normal printer speed, the characters just back
             into a special buffer while the printer tries to catch up.
             Most dot matrix printers are considerably faster than most
             telephone modems, however.  Can be toggled at any time you
             are in the "T", "L" or "E" modes.  Often used to copy items
             from bulletin boards, etc. that are not worth permanently
             saving on disk.
  CTL-Y  - Used only in terminal mode.  If a file was opened prior to
             going to "T" (terminal) mode, nothing will be saved until
             control-Y is typed.  This places a ";" (semicolon) at the
             start of each new line, indicating the memory is "hot" and
             is now copying for saving to a file.  You can toggle this
             off by using control-R.

           NOTE:  To open a file use:  COMMAND: T FILENAME.EXT <cr> and
                  then CTL-Y and CTL-R will control what is copied to
                  be placed in that file.

  CTL-R  - Stops the copy into memory, shuts off the ";" at start of
             each line.  These two commands (CTL-Y to start, and CTL-R
             to stop) control what is being saved.  When returning to
             command (via CTL-E), you will then be warned to save the
             information to disk via the WRT command or it will likely
             be lost.  (You may never use CTL-R although CTL-Y is re-
             quired to commence saving to memory for the disk file you
             previously opened.)
 
                    (These commands -- CTL-P, CTL-Y and CTL-R give
                    MDM712 tremendous versatility.  You can copy
                    incoming data either to disk or to printer (or
                    both).  My own printer is a 300 Baud Teletype
                    Corporation Model 43, yet it works great when I
                    am using the Bell 212A at 1200 Baud.  The printer
                    falls behind, but misses nothing as it eventually
                    catches up with the contents of the large buffer.)

      Additional Subcommands for PMMI Modems

Modem control:
  A - Answer tone for send or receive
  O - Originate tone for send or receive

Parity options:
  1 - Set and check for odd parity
  0 - Set and check for even parity
         Both ends must be capable of these options
         which are available only in R and S modes.        
         The parity checking will be part of the
         file transfer protocol.

Speed Options:
      After entering your primary and secondary options,
      you can set the modem speed by placing a "." after
      the options followed by the speed e.g., 300, 1200.

      EXAMPLE:  SBOT.600 will set the modem for 600 baud

DISCUSSION OF HELP GUIDE, SPECIAL PMMI PAGE:
-------------------------------------------

     When using MDM712 with the PMMI board, you will either dial out or
(far less likely) answer some incoming call.  Since the unit will be in
"originate mode" about 98% of the time, it is set to automatically come
up in the originate mode at default speed (300 Baud) whenever a call has
been completed.  If you want to use answer mode, you need to use the "A"
command.  If a speed is not included, it will stay at the default speed.

     Until a connection has been made, there are no tones applied to the
line.  Originate tones at 300 Baud are automatically added at that time.

     In addition to telling the PMMI modem if it should use originate or
answer tones, you can tell it what Baud rate to use.  A typical command
(once connection is made to another modem) would be:

               B>>COMMAND: TO.600 <RET>

     This puts the tones on the phone line for originate and at the
same time sets the PMMI board for 600 Baud.   Another typical response
might be:

               B>>COMMAND: RABT.450 <RET>

     This places the answer tones on the phone line, sets the program
for receiving batch mode at 450 Baud and returns to terminal mode when
the transfer is completed.

     Other optional PMMI commands seem self-explanatory, such as dis-
connect, etc.

PMMI, HAYES AND ROBOTICS AUTO-DIALING AND AUTO-REDIALING:
--------------------------------------------------------

     There are several very useful and versatile features offered for
the PMMI, Hayes Smartmodem and Robotics users.  These include alternate
long distance dialing systems.

     There are several ways to auto-dial.

          1) from the command line
          2) from the phone number library line

     In addition you can auto-redial from either of these lines.  Once
the number has auto-dialed and there is no answer, it will ask you if
you want it to continuously auto-redial until it does receive an answer
(or you decide to abort).  

     To get the phone library, type CAL <ret> on the command line.  You
then normally just type the alphabetic character at the start of the ap-
propriate line.  It will show the number being dialed.  You can also do
this from the main command line if you know in advance what alphabetic
character is associated with that particular number:

               B>>COMMAND: CAL P <RET>

     This calls up the "P" line in the library and dials that number,
then if busy asks if you want it to continue redialing.  You can use:

               B>>COMMAND: CAL 313-749-6569 <RET>

     and it will dial the number specified.  You can then do either of
these on the library command line, as well.  This gives a tremendous
versatility.

NOTE:  To access the alternate long distance dialing systems (up to two
       are offered), use the phone number overlay and fill in the infor-
       mation regarding your access number, billing number, etc.  It
       will then show how to enter a special character ahead of each
       phone number where alternate long distance system is desired.
       This only works where touch-tone systems are in use.

CASCADING COMMANDS:
------------------

     Several commands may be used on the same line.  Ones normally used
are:  A, B, D, E, L, O, Q, R, S, T, V, X (and Baud rate if PMMI).

     A typical PMMI selection might be: RABQ.300

     The commands have been listed previously but will be listed here
again:

        A) answer tones for PMMI S-100 modem, puts tones online.
        B) batch mode  (must be used at both ends if used at all)
                (usually only available modem-to-modem with operators
                present at each end.)
        E) echo mode for conversing with a system not offering echo.
        L) local echo shows what you are sending if no remote echo.
        O) originate tones for PMMI S-100 modem, puts tones online.
        Q) quiet mode, suppresses messages on local console.
        R) receive file transfers with CRC or checksum protocol.
        S) send file transfers, also shows transfer time.
        T) terminal mode - operates computer at other end like a remote
              terminal.  Also stands for "text mode".  When in "T" mode
              you can copy incoming to printer or to disk, and send pre-
              typed ASCII text files via CTL-T.
        V) visual -- lets you see incoming ASCII files while being sent
              to the disk system.

        NOTE:  The Baud rate is only used for the PMMI S-100 modem.
               Many of the custom overlays allow use of the SET
               command to change Baud rate with non-PMMI modems.

     By this time, most of these parameters are self-explanatory.  They
primarily show how the options and toggles have been set.  The user can
check on any of the major parameters at any time by:

          1) Typing control-E to return to command mode and
          2) Typing  ?  to see the list of current parameters.

INSTALLING THE PROGRAM:
----------------------

     Although this is obviously the very first thing that needs to be
done, it was saved until last for several reasons.  The most important
of these was the need to first explain what some of the options will do
when selected.

     By this time the user should have a fairly good idea what options
would work best for him.  When looking at the beginning of the program
where the these are selected, it should now be rather easy to pick the
ones that are most useful.

     There are various ways to change the program to suit a specific
user.  These are discussed to a modest extent in the information file
called MDM712.INF.  You are offered several methods.  The "easy way" is
to get MDM712.COM plus the appropriate overlay for your computer.  You
then edit the overlay (if needed) to suit your local needs, assemble it
to get a .HEX file then use the simple instruction and DDT.COM to com-
bine the standard MDM712.COM file with your overlay.  The front end of
each overlay contains all the information in the front of the MDM712
source code itself.

     Generally no changes need to be made in specific overlays unless
you have some particular requirement different from others using the
same equipment.  (Such as the log-on message, for example.)

     The "hard way" would be to get the MDM712.ASM source code (which
is around 112k and would take well over an hour to download at 300 Baud)
and then edit it to suit.  This is likely to be quite unsatisfactory for
most users as it will not contain the information peculiar to your com-
puter (which is in the individual overlay you select otherwise.)

     Thus various methods are available, one of which should provide the
easiest method for your system.  

NOTE:  Although designed with special emphasis on the auto-dialing and
       redialing capability of the PMMI, Hayes Smartmodem or Robotics,
       it works quite well on non-PMMI modems.  In the author's system
       a stock Bell 212A Dataphone is used together with a normal ser-
       ial I/O that can be programmed to easily switch from 300 to 1200
       Baud.  The system includes a  Teletype Corp. Model 43 dot matrix
       300 Baud printer.  A great variety of other computers and modems
       can use this same program quite easily.  This is likely the most
       versatile phone modem program currently available for CP/M users.

OUR THANKS TO:
-------------

     A great number of people have contributed to the growth of this
program since 1977.  Two people have been particularly helpful to me in
developing the MDM700 series modem programs:  Keith Petersen (W8SDZ)
and Frank Gaude' (ex-K6IBE).  Their help and interest have been greatly
appreciated.

     We hope this verstile program will give you hours of enjoyment and
fulfill your modem needs.  It has long been a goal of mine to provide
the same program for the people using the Hayes Smartmodem (or Robotics)
as for those using the PMMI 103 modem.
