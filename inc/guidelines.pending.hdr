that is about to open.

**IMPORTANT**: All **tentative** [rules](rules.html) and [guidelines](guidelines.html)
are subject to change by the [IOCCC judges](../judges.html) at any time.
See both the [IOCCC news](../news.html) and the [IOCCC
Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@ioccc) feed as _sometimes_ the
[IOCCC judges](../judges.html) _mention_ changes there.

See our
FAQ on "[rules, guidelines, tools feedback](../faq.html#feedback)"
as well as our
FAQ on "[about asking questions](../faq.html#question)"
about these guidelines. You might also find the FAQ in general useful, especially the
FAQ on "[how to enter the IOCCC](../quick-start.html#enter)".
