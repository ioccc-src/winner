An amazing entry!

The official chef enjoyed solving the maze, which she did on the first
attempt.


## Author's remarks:

### Interactive 3D Maze

Step into a randomly generated 3D maze and try to get out alive!  Use the vi
movement keys (`hjkl`) to move on a level, and `u` or `d` to move (u)p or (d)own
from a position with a `U` or `D` on the map.  To simulate the feeling of being
in an unknown labyrinth, areas which you have not visited cannot be seen.

Reach the north-west left corner of level 1 to exit.
