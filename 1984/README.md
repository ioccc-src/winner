# First annual Obfuscated C Code Contest

In [1984](../years.html#1984), the first contest was held.  The name of the
contest was simply "`First annual Obfuscated C Code Contest`".

View the `index.html` web page for the given winning entry for information on how
to compile it and how to run the winning program.  Look at the winning
source and try to figure how it does what it does!  This year we only had
remarks from two authors but these came years later.

Restrictions against machine dependent code were not in the [rules](rules.txt)
in 1984. The source file size restriction was only 512 bytes.
[Rules](rules.txt) and [results](../years.html#1984) were posted to _net.lang.c_
and _net.unix-wizards_. The contest was announced in a [net.lang.c
post](https://groups.google.com/g/net.lang.c/c/lx-TAuEyeRI/m/HdOOnNx6LC0J).
