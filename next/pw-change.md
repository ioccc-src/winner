# Change your submit server initial password

Using the **Username** and **Initial password** you receive via
email in [step 3](../quick-start.html#step_3), you need to login to the [IOCCC submit
server](https://submit.ioccc.org).

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: You must change your password **WITHIN 72 HOURS**
from when one of the [IOCCC judges](../judges.html) sent that email.

**NOTE**: The [IOCCC submit server](https://submit.ioccc.org) will be ready
for submissions **ONLY WHEN THE CONTEST IS [open](../faq.html#open)**.  See
[current status of the IOCCC](../status.html) for details on the contest status.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: When the contest is [closed](../faq.html#closed), the
[IOCCC submit server](https://submit.ioccc.org)
may be offline and unreachable as a website.

To login and change your password, open [https://submit.ioccc.org](https://submit.ioccc.org)
in your browser.  It should look like this:

<img src="../png/submit.login.png"
 alt="submit server login screen"
 width=710 height=562>

The username is the UUID you are provided when a judge replies to your request
to register for the IOCCC and the password is the initial password you are
given. Click "Login".

After you log in, if this is the first time you have logged in with this UUID,
you will be required to change your password. Assuming everything is fine, that
would look something like:

<img src="../png/submit.first-login.png"
 alt="submit server password change required"
 width=710 height=808>

As you can see, on your first login you **MUST** change your password. If you do
not do this within 72 hours **YOUR ACCOUNT WILL BE CLOSED** and you'll have to
register again!

Put in your login (UUID username), your old (initial) password and a new password.

Click "Change Password".

**NOTE**: if you have put in your old password, you'll see something like:

<img src="../png/submit.invalid-passwd.png"
 alt="submit server password change error"
 width=710 height=808>

Once you've changed your password you will be able to log in again with your UUID
username and new password. This is what it will look like when you change your
password:

<img src="../png/submit.passwd-changed.png"
 alt="submit server password changed"
 width=710 height=344>

When the contest is [open](../faq.html#open), proceed with
[Step 5: Obtain and compile the latest mkiocccentry toolkit](../quick-start.html#step_5).
