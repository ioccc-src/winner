# C compiler settings

# Common C compiler warnings to silence
#
# Example: CSILENCE= -Wno-int-conversion
#
CSILENCE= -Wno-poison-system-directories -Wno-unsafe-buffer-usage -Wno-overriding-deployment-version

# Attempt to silence unknown warning options
#
CUNKNOWN= -Wno-unknown-warning-option

# Common C compiler warning flags
#
# NOTE: The addition of -pedantic to CWARN is a challenge that
#       You may wish to avoid if it proves too problematic.
#       There is NO penalty for removing -pedantic from CWARN.
#
CWARN= -Wall -Wextra -pedantic ${CSILENCE} ${CUNKNOWN}

# Compiler standard
#
# XXX - Your IOCCC submission is free to require older C standards, or
# XXX - even not specify a C standard at all.  We suggest trying
# XXX - for -std=gnu17, but that is not a requirement and you won't
# XXX - be penalized if you name CSTD empty or use another
# XXX - well known and reasonably widely implemented C standard.
#
CSTD= -std=gnu17

# Compiler bit architecture
#
# Example for 32-bitness: ARCH= -m32
# Example for 64-bitness: ARCH= -m64
#
# NOTE: Normally one should NOT specify a specific architecture.
#
ARCH=

# Defines that are needed to compile
#
# Example: -Dfoo -Dbar=baz
#
CDEFINE=

# Include files that are needed to compile
#
# Example: CINCLUDE= -include stdio.h
#
CINCLUDE=

# Other flags to pass to the C compiler
#
# Example: COTHER= -fno-math-errno
#
COTHER=

# Optimization
#
# NOTE: Feel free to change the level of compiler optimization.
#       The "-O3" is just a friendly default you might wish to try.
#
# Example: OPT= -O0 -g
#
OPT= -O3

# Default flags for ANSI C compilation
#
CFLAGS= ${CSTD} ${CWARN} ${ARCH} ${CDEFINE} ${CINCLUDE} ${COTHER} ${OPT}

# Libraries needed to build

# Example: LDFLAGS= -lncurses -lm

# C compiler to use
#
# NOTE: The IOCCC Judges recommend you leave CC as just "cc"
#       and NOT set it to clang, or gcc, or something else
#       unless you have a STRONG reason to do so.
#
#       Setting CC to something other than "cc" makes your
#       code less portable to those who do not have your
#       particular C compiler.  **hint**
#
#       If you want to test your code with a particular C compiler,
#       use the make command line.  For example:
#
#           make all CC=clang
#           make all CC=gcc
#
CC= cc

# Compiler add-ons or replacements for clang only
#
ifeq "$(findstring $(CLANG),${CC})" "$(CLANG)"
#
# NOTE: This code is only invoked when CC is "clang"
#       such as when you use the make command line:
#
#           make all CC=clang
#
CSILENCE+=
#
CWARN+= -Weverything
#
endif

# Specific add-ons or replacements for gcc only
#
ifeq "$(findstring $(GCC),${CC})" "$(GCC)"
#
# NOTE: This code is only invoked when CC is "gcc"
#       such as when you use the make command line:
#
#    make all CC=gcc
#
CSILENCE+=
#
CWARN+=
