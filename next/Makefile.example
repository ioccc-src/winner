# Your IOCCC submission is free to require older C standards, or
# even not specify a C standard at all.  We suggest trying
# for -std=gnu17, but that is not a requirement and you won't
# be penalized if you name CSTD empty or use another
# well known and reasonably widely implemented C standard.

# Example for 32-bitness: ARCH= -m32
# Example for 64-bitness: ARCH= -m64

# NOTE: Normally one should not specify a specific architecture.
