<div id="step_c">
## Step C: Open the Subscription consent email message
</div>

Look for an automated email message from the FreeLists List Manager (_ecartis@freelists.org_).

The email message will have the subject:

> Subscription consent for 'ioccc28-reg'

**NOTE**: Beware that your email service, application and/or Internet
Service Provider (ISP) might modify email subject lines.  For example, some string
might have been prepended or appended to the subject line.  Beware of
this when you search for the Subscription consent" email.

**NOTE**: The "Subscription consent" email is usually sent by the FreeLists
List Manager within a minute after clicking the **((Next >>))** button.
If you don't see the "Subscription consent" email, check your spam folder.

**NOTE**: If are having trouble receiving the "Subscription consent" email, and
you have tried a few times, [Contact the IOCCC](../contact.html) to ask the
[IOCCC judges](../judges.html) for assistance.

This email will contain a URL of the form:
`https://www.freelists.org/v/ioccc28-reg/SOME-RANDOM-STUFF`.

Click on that link. The email might look the below:

**NOTE**: If you prefer to **NOT** click links in email, simply copy that
URL from your "Subscription consent email" and paste it into your browser.


<div id="step_d">
## Step D: Confirm your email click
</div>

In your browser, for the link referenced in [Step C](#step_c), click the **((Next >>))** button.

# How the contest status impacts registration
</div>


### When the IOCCC status is _closed_

While the contest is **[CLOSED](../faq.html#closed)**,
you **CANNOT REGISTER** as there is no contest for which you can register.

Watch the [IOCCC news](../news.html) and the [IOCCC Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@ioccc)
for news about the next IOCCC as you may register when the contest is [pending](../faq.html#pending)
or [open](../faq.html#open).


### When the IOCCC status is _pending_

While the contest is **[PENDING](../faq.html#pending)**,
you may **register for contest**, however you will **NOT**
receive an email message containing your [IOCCC submit server](https://submit.ioccc.org)
*Username and Initial Password* **until the IOCCC is [open](../faq.html#open)**.


### When the IOCCC status is _open_

While the contest is **[OPEN](../faq.html#open)**,
you may **register for the contest**.  Once you are registered **AND**
the contest is [open](../faq.html#open), you will receive an email message containing your very own
**Username and Initial Password until the contest is [open](../faq.html#open)**.  You will need these
to be able to "**[upload your submissions](submit.html)**" to the
[IOCCC submit server](https://submit.ioccc.org).

See also the
FAQ on "[how to upload your submission](../faq.html#submit)"
for more information on the submission process when the IOCCC [reopens](../faq.html#open).


### When the IOCCC status is _judging_

While the contest is **[PENDING](../faq.html#pending)**,
you **CANNOT REGISTER** because the
[IOCCC judges](../judges.html) are in the process of judging the [submissions](../faq.html#how_many)
they received while the contest was [open](../faq.html#open).

Watch the [IOCCC news](../news.html) and the [IOCCC Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@ioccc)
for news about the next IOCCC as you may register when the contest is [pending](../faq.html#pending)
or [open](../faq.html#open).
