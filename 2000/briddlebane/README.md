## To build:

``` <!---sh-->
    make
```


## To use:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./briddlebane
```


## Try:

For some fun every time you log in try running this from your `.bashrc` or
equivalent file!

You might also like to try:

``` <!---sh-->
    ./try.sh

    INSULTS=15 ./try.sh
```


## Judges' remarks:

One could argue that this program was a "`diseased dumpster of tripe`"
but I suspect that would only result in the judges being heckled as a
"`scum-encrusted congress of obscurity`" (but only if it was in the early
evening of Dec 22, 2000).

Can you find out how it stores the insult strings?  Can you then take
an insult and figure out when it will be uttered?


## Authors' remarks:

This program was broadcast from deep within the Zarbonic Cluster
and received at 9:03pm on March 21st, 2000 by Moxen N. Briddlebane.
The original author, as designated by other components of the
transmission, refers to himself simply as "Lord Zarbon", though
offers no information in relation to the significance of that
post. The sole purpose of this program appears to be to degrade
and humiliate the people of this planet by calling them names.
It takes no input, it only produces a single line of slanderous output.

The program appears to be rather confused, internally. It is
unclear whether or not "Lord Zarbon" truly understands the
mechanics of programming. What is particularly disturbing is
the curious method of insult-encoding employed by this program.
Furthermore, it is ambiguous how said data is arranged and why
it is necessary to resort to trigonometric functions to handle
it.  One of the real mysteries involves the numbers `114` and
`2`, which are, according to Lord Zarbon, very deliberate.
